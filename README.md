# Aminoacids-ASA
Algorithms analysis and synthesis, Project 3 (LEIC-A 25/26 - IST)

The project consists of an algorithm that uses Dynamic Programming (DP) to find the best aminoacids removal order, from a given sequence of aminoacids, minimizing the sum of the removal energies.

This project was built in c++ to ensure performance and to keep things simple.
Consider [a Rust implementation](https://github.com/Cosm-gedenke/ASA-analysis-and-synthesis-of-algorithms-LEIC-IST/tree/main/Project1) in case of preference.
